## Licensing

As this was initially generated with AI, *the source code* (as far as I'm
aware, as of June 2025) is automatically public domain. `main.py` in the initial
commit of this repo is completely public domain, and is marked with the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)

However, any code I've written since that initial generation is licensed under
the GPL. Thus, for all other commits, this project will be under the GPL.
